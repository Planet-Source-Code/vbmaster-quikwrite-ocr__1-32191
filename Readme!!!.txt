Hello!
=====

This project is my 'trial' to make an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program
Before i made this project I'v looked at other OCR projects, but in all of them i'v seen NNT (Neural Net) and this is VERY COMPLICATED!!!
i wan't to make a simple project, without NNT so i thought about arrays, and guess what - It worked!
This is a very simple project, it knows how to recognize only 5 numbers (1 to 5) and it is a litle bit slow.... but not to much ( After all, its Microshit and VB :) )

How to use:
==========

Simply!, no no...
when you will open this project, press RUN, the first button you will press is 'INIT INSERT'. Wait until the Debug Text  Window showes "Done".
then:
1) Draw the number (Again, 1 to 5 only!!) like in the pics of the numbers in the writing area.
2) Press 'Mark' - this will draw a rectangle to bound the image you drew.
3) Press 'Execute' - this will make an array of 70x70 celles (4900 pixels for all the picture) which will include, in binary string, what you drew.
4) Press 'Cls' -  to clear the image you drew.

To make all this things automaticly, check the checkbox "Recognize after mouse UP", when you will finish drawing your image, stop pressing the mouse and it will be automaticly recognized.
